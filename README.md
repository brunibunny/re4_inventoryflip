##

A simple wrapper created to emulate movements from the right analog stick using the keyboard.
Created for Resident Evil 4, to workaround the fact that the developers were not bothered to add keyboard bindings to flip items in the inventory.

Bindings:
- Home: Flip up
- End: Flip down
- Page Up: Flip right
- Insert: Flip left

Instalation:
Copy the provided xinput1_3.dll to "Steam\steamapps\common\Resident Evil 4\Bin32"

The code is based on [di2xinput](https://github.com/acceleration3/di2xinput).
